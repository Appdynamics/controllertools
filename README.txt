WARNING:

this directory contains COMPLETELY unsupported tools.  

if you fork them, modify them, use them without the active cooperation of an appdynamics 
support engineer, you can horribly damage your controller installation, trash your database,
acquire STDs, halitosis and a bald patch.

also, any embedded documentation is guaranteed to be incorrect or misleading.
if you do not have a deep understanding of the employed programming language and the
data structures that are being manipulated, you are likely to run into trouble.

HERE BE DRAGONS.   YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

controller tools, usually shell scripts, for diagnosing and manipulating appd controllers

space_projection.sh:  
	look at a controller installation, and project how big it would grow if every day 
was worst case.

create_threadpools.sh: 
	make saas-like thread pools

dumprestore-gen.sh:
	generate Windows metadata dump/restore program and often include a fresh db/data.zip also (completeness depends on other efforts)
